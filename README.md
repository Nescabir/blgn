# About

So this was my first React project. It's a complete redesign and rethinking of my previous portfolio which was a template. This one is 100% made by my little hands.  
I am no graphic designer, so it's not the best looking website, but it's usable.

## What did I use

### Dependencies
- Create-react-app
- React 17.0.2
- React router 5.2.0
- Typescript 4.2.3
- Node-Sass 5.0.0
- Devicon 2.10.1
- Material-UI 4.11.3 (and it's lab package)
- React FontAwesome 0.1.14

### Others
- VSCode
- React documentation
- Google

## How to use it

It's fairly simple, just clone the repo with `git clone`, install the deps with `npm install` and you should be good to go. You just need to `npm run start` after that !
